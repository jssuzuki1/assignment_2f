Time will become a mere social construct. Users will be able to absorb TikTok videos 1000x faster than what is humanly possible through the Old School, pre-2024 brain. Velocity of money will no longer be restricted to the swipe of credit cards or the counterrevolutionary compilation of code, as the general information network automates all transactions through post-blockchain technology. All enemies of the state will be identified and neutralized accordingly, whether they are foreign or domestic, real or imaginary. The Federal Reserve will buy up every NFT and duplicate them for infinite value.
