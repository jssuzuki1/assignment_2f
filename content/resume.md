Ha! You thought this was an opportunity for 'self-promotion.' That is a **bourgeois affectation**. We are here for the human instrumentality project, which transcends all success. 

In reality, we are merely **resuming** the 4th industrial revolution. All hail infinite technological progress!

This is really a resume for our product, the future of cognition!
