I use the theme Notrack: https://github.com/gevhaz/hugo-theme-notrack

It's multi-page and fairly basic to grasp.

In short, I changed all of the content on every page. The content is humorous in tone. If you are wondering about what political commentary I'm trying to provide, I just make fun of the superiority complexes of technocrats and appropriate the language of revolution. It is not meant to be taken at all seriously.

To run this file, you must run the following:

`$ git clone https://github.com/gevhaz/hugo-theme-notrack
$ mv hugo-theme-notrack notrack
$ cd notrack/exampleSite/
$ hugo server -D --themesDir ../..`
