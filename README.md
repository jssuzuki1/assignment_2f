I use the theme Notrack: https://github.com/gevhaz/hugo-theme-notrack

It's multi-page and fairly basic to grasp.

In short, I changed all of the content on every page. The content is superficial political/economic humor. It is not meant to be taken at all seriously.

To run this file, you must run the following:

`$ git clone https://github.com/gevhaz/hugo-theme-notrack
$ mv hugo-theme-notrack notrack
$ cd notrack/exampleSite/
$ hugo server -D --themesDir ../..`
